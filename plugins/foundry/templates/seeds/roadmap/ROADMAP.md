# Roadmap

## Board conventions

Run `scripts/board.sh` to render the board; `scripts/board.sh "Epic 0"` filters to one epic.

- A **card** is one table row: `Id | Work | Status | Spec | Depends on`. The `Id` is a
  unique, slug-safe (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`) handle — required on claimable cards (Ready /
  In progress / Validating), enforced by `scripts/check-board.py` in the gate. Claim a card
  by adding `(@<owner>)` to its Work cell; never take a card another agent owns. Respect the
  Depends-on column.
- An **In progress** card names where its work lives: the branch, and the absolute
  worktree path when the work sits in a separate or out-of-repo worktree. A harness that
  resumes the card reads this to find existing work instead of guessing.
- A card's **status** is its column: `Backlog → Ready → In progress → Validating →
  Done` (+ `Superseded`, terminal). `Blocked` and the owner are flags, not columns.
- The dashboard groups cards by **epic**; the epic order is the priority order.
- **`Done` requires a recorded gate PASS** — the gate is the evaluator, not the
  author's assertion.
- The un-carded idea pool is `roadmap/BACKLOG.md`; an idea stays there until committed.

### Status taxonomy

Use these words in board tables and spec status headers.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Done | Implemented and verified by a recorded gate PASS. |
| Validating | Code landed; the repo's canonical gate is running. |
| In progress | Partially implemented, being hardened, or recently landed with known follow-up. |
| Ready | Spec'd — `roadmap/specs/<feature>/` design and tasks approved, prerequisites met; claimable. |
| Planned | Accepted direction; not started, or scheduled behind prerequisites. |
| Backlog | Captured, not yet committed to build. |
| Blocked | Direction known; work waits on an external dependency or an earlier workstream. |
| Superseded | Preserved for history or rationale; no longer the forward plan. |

## Standing rules

**Naming.** `knowledge/glossary.md` is the vocabulary contract. Use `Done`, never "complete", for implementation state. Inline the most-violated glossary rules here as they emerge.
- The board wins over any per-feature spec.
- Every spec status header points here.
