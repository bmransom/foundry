# foundry-template: worktree-retire v1
#
# Retire a git worktree WITHOUT silently losing gitignored notes.
#
# `git worktree remove` deletes gitignored files with no warning; it only
# refuses on *untracked-but-not-ignored* files, never on ignored ones. This
# wrapper enumerates the worktree's gitignored files with the one command that
# lists them individually — `git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard`
# (`git status --ignored` collapses a directory to a single line and misses
# them) — and REFUSES to remove a worktree that still holds un-promoted notes.
#
# Promote durable notes to the TRACKED tree first (docs/ROADMAP.md, specs/,
# docs/BACKLOG.md), commit, then retire. `--force` deletes anyway.
#
# Usage: scripts/worktree-retire.sh <worktree-path> [--force]
